SQL Databases:

Structure: SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational and use a tabular structure with predefined schemas. They are best suited for structured data.
Query Language: SQL databases use SQL to query and manipulate data.
ACID properties: They typically support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, ensuring data integrity.
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.
Use Cases:
Transactional systems: Banking systems, e-commerce platforms.
Applications requiring complex queries: Reporting, analytics.
NoSQL Databases:

Structure: NoSQL databases are non-relational and offer more flexible data models, such as key-value pairs, document-oriented, column-oriented, or graph databases.
Query Language: NoSQL databases may not use a standard querying language like SQL. Some have their own query languages or APIs.
Scalability: NoSQL databases are often designed to scale horizontally, making them suitable for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.
Examples: MongoDB (document-based), Cassandra (column-based), Redis (key-value store), Neo4j (graph database).
Use Cases:
Big data and real-time web applications: Social media, IoT (Internet of Things) platforms.
Applications dealing with unstructured data: Content management, mobile apps with variable data structures.
