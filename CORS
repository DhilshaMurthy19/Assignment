CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It's a security feature implemented in web browsers to control how web pages or web applications can request resources from another domain. When a web application hosted on one domain (origin) tries to access resources from a different domain (different origin), the browser's security policies may restrict such actions by default.
Working:
•	Same-Origin Policy: Browsers, by default, follow the Same-Origin Policy, which restricts JavaScript code in a web page from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.
•	CORS Headers: When a browser detects a cross-origin request (e.g., an XMLHttpRequest or Fetch API request), it sends an HTTP request with an "Origin" header indicating the requesting domain. The server, in response, can include specific CORS headers indicating whether it allows requests from that origin.
Handling CORS-related Issues:
•	Server-side Configuration: To enable CORS, the server needs to respond with appropriate CORS headers allowing access from specific origins. These headers include Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, Access-Control-Allow-Headers, etc.
•	Preflight Requests: For certain types of requests (e.g., PUT, DELETE, or requests with custom headers), the browser may send a preflight OPTIONS request to check if the server allows the actual request. The server must respond with appropriate CORS headers to allow the actual request.
•	Client-side Solutions: If you're developing a front-end application, using certain libraries or frameworks (like Axios for HTTP requests in JavaScript), they might offer built-in solutions or configurations to handle CORS issues.
•	Proxy Server: Another approach is to set up a proxy server that acts as an intermediary between your front-end and the server, which can forward requests and manage CORS headers appropriately.
Discuss three coding best practices that you consider important for maintaining a clean and efficient codebase.
Maintaining a clean and efficient codebase is essential for readability, scalability, and ease of maintenance. Here are three important coding best practices:
1. Consistent and Meaningful Naming Conventions:
Naming variables, functions, classes, and other identifiers in a consistent and descriptive manner is crucial. It enhances readability and comprehension for anyone reading the code. Use meaningful names that accurately describe the purpose or functionality of the entity. Here are some tips:
•	Use descriptive names that convey intent.
•	Follow a consistent naming convention (like camelCase, snake_case, etc.) throughout the codebase.
•	Avoid ambiguous abbreviations; prefer clarity over brevity.
•	Choose names that provide context without needing excessive comments.
2. Modularity and Code Reusability:
Breaking down code into modular components and promoting code reuse helps maintain a cleaner and more maintainable codebase. Encapsulate functionalities into separate functions, classes, or modules to:
•	Promote single responsibility: Each function or module should ideally handle a single task.
•	Encourage code reuse: Identifying common functionalities and abstracting them into reusable components reduces redundancy.
•	Simplify testing and debugging: Smaller, modular components are easier to test and debug compared to large, monolithic blocks of code.
3. Consistent Formatting and Code Style:
Adhering to a consistent code style and formatting guidelines across the codebase aids in readability and reduces confusion. It also fosters collaboration among developers. Consider these practices:
•	Use consistent indentation, spacing, and line breaks to improve code readability.
•	Follow a consistent style guide for your programming language (such as PEP 8 for Python, Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide, etc.).
•	Utilize automated formatting tools (like Prettier, Black, or ESLint) to enforce a consistent style and format automatically.
•	By implementing these best practices consistently throughout your codebase, you can enhance its readability, maintainability, and overall efficiency. It facilitates collaboration among developers and minimizes potential issues during maintenance and scaling of the project.
